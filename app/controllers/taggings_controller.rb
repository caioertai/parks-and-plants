    # Strong params variations:
    # Note: We ended up moving away from this. But I left it here for reference.

    # For a string (most common by far)  ðŸ‘‡
    # params.require(:tagging).permit(:tag_id)

    # For an array                       ðŸ‘‡
    # params.require(:tagging).permit(tag_id: [])

  def tag_ids
    # The fact that we are using a for for a tagging to create multiple taggings
    # makes it clunky that we have an array of multiple ids in a key named tag_id
    # I preferered to hide this under this method that has a pluralized name:
    # tag_ids
    params[:tagging][:tag_id]

    # Note: the clunky reject blank isn't necessary anymore because of the
    # include_hidden: false on the form. Check the taggings#new view.
